The short-range ballistic missile landed some 60km (37 miles) from the South's city of Sokcho and triggered air-raid alarms on Ulleungdo island.

South Korea later fired three missiles in response to the North.

Seoul's President Yoon Suk-yeol had called Pyongyang's launch an "effective territorial invasion".

Pyongyang fired at least 10 missiles "east and west" on Wednesday morning, the South Korean military said.

Later on Wednesday, South Korea's military said it had fired three air-to-ground missiles towards north of its maritime border, in response to the North's launch.

It had earlier declared that military could not "tolerate this kind of North Korea's provocative act, and will strictly and firmly respond under close South Korea-U.S. cooperation," said the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a statement.

They added South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol had ordered a "swift response" to the latest aggression.

Both South Korea and Japan's leaders have called national security meetings in response to North Korea's latest firings.
